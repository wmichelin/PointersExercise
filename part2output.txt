Part 2 - Dynamic Memory Management
Pointer ptrC has the data: 0x0
Pointer ptrD has the data: 0x0
Using ptrC, the dynamic variable is at location 0x7ff0e1c039b0
Using ptrD, the dynamic variable is at location 0x7ff0e1c039c0
Using ptrC, the data store in the dynamic variable is 0
Using ptrD, the data store in the dynamic variable is 0
Draw diagrams to illustrate the above 






Using ptrC, the data stored in the dynamic variable is 125
Using ptrD, the data stored in the dynamic variable is 504
Draw diagrams to illustrate the above and explain what happened


After the assignment operation:  

Using ptrC, the dynamic variable is at location 0x7ff0e1c039b0
Using ptrC, the data stored in the dynamic variable is 125

Using ptrD, the dynamic variable is at location 0x7ff0e1c039b0
Using ptrD, the data stored in the dynamic variable is 125
Draw diagrams to illustrate the above and explain what happened
