Part 3 - Dynamically Instantiating Objects 
Pointer cmpPtr1 has the data: 0x0
Pointer cmpPtr2 has the data: 0x0
Using cmpPtr1, the dynamic variable is at location 0x7fea534039b0
Using cmpPtr2, the dynamic variable is at location 0x7fea534039c0
Using cmpPtr1, the data stored in the dynamic Complex object is 0
Using cmpPtr2, the data stored in the dynamic Complex object is 0
Draw diagrams to illustrate the above 






enter complex number 1: 1 2
enter complex number 2: 3 4
Using cmpPtr1, the data stored in the dynamic Complex object is 1+2i
Using cmpPtr2, the data stored in the dynamic Complex object is 3+4i
Draw diagrams to illustrate the above and explain what happened
