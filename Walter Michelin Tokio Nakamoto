Part 1 - Pointer variables
Pointer ptrA has the data: 0x0
Pointer ptrB has the data: 0x0

Variable a is stored at address  0x7fff5d47e758
Pointer ptrA is stored at address 0x7fff5d47e748
Variable b is stored at address  0x7fff5d47e754
Pointer ptrB is stored at address 0x7fff5d47e740
Draw diagrams to illustrate the above 







 Using a, Variable a holds the value 225
Pointer ptrA holds the value 0x7fff5d47e758

 Using ptrA, Variable a holds the value 225



After 1st assignment operation:  

The data stored in ptrA  is  0x7fff5d47e758
Using ptrA, the data stored in a  is 225
Using a, the data stored in a  is 225

 ptrA is at location 0x7fff5d47e748

 Using ptrA, a is at location 0x7fff5d47e758

 Using a, a is at location 0x7fff5d47e758
The data stored in ptrB  is 225
Using ptrB, the data stored in b  is 225
Using b, the data stored in b  is 167

 Using ptrB, b is at location 0x7fff5d47e758

 Using b, b is at location 0x7fff5d47e754
Draw diagrams to illustrate the above and explain what happened







After 2nd assignment operation 

The data stored in ptrA  is  0x7fff5d47e758
Using ptrA, the data stored in a  is 987
Using a, the data stored in a  is 987

 ptrA is at location 0x7fff5d47e748

 Using ptrA, a is at location 0x7fff5d47e758

 Using a, a is at location 0x7fff5d47e758
The data stored in ptrB  is 0x7fff5d47e758
Using ptrB, the data stored in b  is 987
Using b, the data stored in b  is 167

 Using ptrB, b is at location 0x7fff5d47e758

 Using b, b is at location 0x7fff5d47e754
Draw diagrams to illustrate the above and explain what happened
